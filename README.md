# Unit 10 OOP Homework: Template Engine - Employee Summary


## Creating a template engine

```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```

This CLI is a great tool for creating a quick, easy to reference html page that displays your teams pertinant information. Using Inquirer and test driven development I was able to set up a set of files that connected to the provided front end files to generate user profile cards from user input. Utilizing Jest allowed me to test after each portion of code was completed on my class and subclass constructors.
